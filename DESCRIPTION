Description: IPCO is an open-source R library that infers functionality for a 16S
				dataset. IPCO can be implemented using internal or external reference
				data as per convinience. The references provided in IPCO are
				generated with UniRef90 database and the largest and manually
				curated MetaCyc mapping file provided along with
				HUMAnN2. It implements a double co-inertia methodology on the
				reference taxonomy and functionality database and
				co-varies it with the queried data.
